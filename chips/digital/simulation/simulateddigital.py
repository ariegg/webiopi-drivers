#   Changelog
#
#   1.0    2016-07-29    Initial release.
#   1.1    2017-01-27    File rename and comments added.
#
#   Config parameters
#
#   - channels       Integer       Number of digital channels. Default is 8.
#
#   Usage remarks
#
#   - You can use this device just like ordinary devices by e.g. using it in the
#     config file.
#   - As pure artificial device it has no hardware dependency at all. For that reason
#     no bus parameter is necessary.
#   - You can use this device to do some testing prior to having the real physical chips
#     available to e.g. create some user interface in advance.
#   - You can use this devices also to check the correctness of some REST API calls
#     that use the digital I/O values.
#
#   Implementation remarks
#
#   - For simplicity, the simulated digital device name is just the upper case version of
#     the underlying digital abstraction.
