Here the files for the Quantity Vector implementation are located.

The concept of a Quantity Vector is furtehr explained in the FMF white paper on page 12 that can be found here https://github.com/ariegg/full-metadata_format.

This implementaiton is lightwheight in the sense as it allows to create Quantity Vector objects, access its components and get unit strings that use only base SI units. It does not cover any other non-SI units and conversions.
