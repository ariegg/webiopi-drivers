Here the files for the Quantity Vector implementation are located.

The concept of a Quantity Vector is further explained in the FMF white paper on page 12 that can be found here https://github.com/ariegg/full-metadata_format.

This implementation is lightwheight in the sense that it allows to create Quantity Vector objects, access its vector components and get unit strings that use only base SI units. It does not cover any other non-SI units and value/unit conversions in any form.
